# Arabic Text Normalization and NER Project
This project focuses on normalizing Arabic text and using Named Entity Recognition (NER) with the CAMeL-BERT model. The project cleans Arabic text and highlights different entity types (such as persons and locations).

## Features <br>
**Text Normalization**: Cleans Arabic text by removing Tashkel, unifying Alef/Yeh forms.<br>
**Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Uses the CAMeL-BERT model to identify named entities in Arabic text.<br>
**Highlighting**: Displays different entity types with color coding (e.g., locations in green, persons in red) for better visualization.
